# DOM Event Handling Practice

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for handling various DOM events like `click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, and `dblclick`. The webpage contains buttons that trigger different actions when interacted with, showcasing how to dynamically manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.

## Features
Click Event : Changes the button color to light blue.
Mouseover Event : Displays a message near the button when the mouse is hovered over it.
Mouseout Event : Hides the message when the mouse moves away from the button.
Double-click Event : Hides the button when double-clicked.

## HTML Structure

The webpage includes:
- A heading.
- Three buttons (`Button 1`, `Button 2`, `Button 3`).
- Three hidden message elements that appear when hovering over the respective button.

## JavaScript Code

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the following functions:
changeColor : Changes the background color of a button when it is clicked.
showMessage : Displays a message when the mouse hovers over the button.
hideMessage : Hides the message when the mouse is moved away from the button.
hideButton : Hides the button when double-clicked.

Each function is attached to an event listener on the respective buttons.
